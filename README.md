_"You mine, you craft, and you use plugins, but you certainly don't call it 'caving'."_

Plain and simple, this is a spin-off of Minecraft. I am very familiar with the mechanics of Minecraft but I am not happy with the implementation. No, I don't hate Java - on the contrary I think it's really cool. I just prefer C++.

## Project Goals
This will be completely plugin-based, to the point of vanlla behavior being an optional plugin. Obviously this system isn't as easy in C++ as it is in Java, as there's no reflection or any mechanisms to ensure compatibility, but I'll find a way to make it work. Unfortunately I'll not be able to use anything from C++'s standard library without running into compatibility problems. I'll also have to be concious of padding. You can be concious of my mistakes.

The goal is to make the vanilla behavior closely remeble that of Minecraft, but have an emphasis on installing community-made plugins (if such a community exists). I'm intentionally setting impossible expectations because I want to see what I can do.

Current target goal: inter/intra-dimensional portals that you can see through and walk through, like _real_ portals, not that mystery stuff in Minecraft.

## How this will be different from Minecraft
There's no such thing as the surface. There's no such thing as a hight limit. There's no such thing as the void or bedrock. Just endless caves... how deep can you go? How many things can you build? 3D crafting will warp your brain, and you will be obsessed with automation.

### The Storyline
You run the game executable for the first time, and you're given a chance to start any recording software. Then the storyline starts.

You're decending a mineshaft elevator. You arrive at the bottom. You look around and see darkness; your only lightsource is a near-empty lantern you are holding. You hear all manner of sounds. You feel like you're being watched. You only have a periodically delivered set of supplies to work with. You were asked to continually send mined materials back up the shaft. What will you do?
